# Binary-Calculator
Objective

In this challenge, we implement a calculator that uses binary numbers.

Task

Implement a simple calculator that performs the following operations on binary numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. Note that division operation must be integer division only; for example: 1001/10=10   , 1110/101=10.

Constraints

    - All expressions in the test dataset are entered in the form operand1 -> operator -> operand2 where operand1 is the first binary
    number, operand2 is the second binary number,operator and is in the set {+, -, *, =}
    
    - Both operands will always be positive integers when converted from base 2 to base 10.
    
    - All expressions will be valid.
